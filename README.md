## Key Features

1. Automated Search Query Generation:
   - The Python script analyzes user preferences and interests to generate a continuous stream of search queries.
   - It utilizes natural language processing techniques and HuggingFace models to generate relevant and diverse queries based on user-defined topics and keywords.

2. Web Scraping and Article Extraction:
   - The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and retrieve web pages containing news articles.
   - BeautifulSoup is employed to parse the HTML structure of the web pages and extract the URLs of relevant articles based on search queries.
   - The content of the articles is extracted by parsing the HTML structure or utilizing HuggingFace models for text extraction, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the articles.

3. Content Summarization and Sentiment Analysis:
   - The HuggingFace small models are applied to perform text summarization, extracting key information from the scraped news articles.
   - Sentiment analysis is conducted using HuggingFace models to determine the sentiment expressed within the articles, allowing users to filter content based on emotional tones.

4. Personalized News Curation:
   - The AI-driven program continually learns from user behavior and preferences to curate a personalized news feed.
   - It adapts to user feedback, rating articles, and analyzing engagement metrics to further refine the article recommendations.
