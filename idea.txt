Title: Autonomously Curated News Aggregator

Description: The Autonomously Curated News Aggregator is a Python-based AI project that autonomously scrapes and curates news articles from various sources based on user-defined search queries. The project utilizes tools like BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape web pages and extract relevant article URLs and content without relying on local files or hardcoding URLs. Additionally, it leverages HuggingFace small models for natural language processing tasks.

Key Features:

1. Automated Search Query Generation:
   - The Python script analyzes user preferences and interests to generate a continuous stream of search queries.
   - It utilizes natural language processing techniques and HuggingFace models to generate relevant and diverse queries based on user-defined topics and keywords.

2. Web Scraping and Article Extraction:
   - The script uses the requests library to send HTTP requests and retrieve web pages containing news articles.
   - BeautifulSoup is employed to parse the HTML structure of the web pages and extract the URLs of relevant articles based on search queries.
   - The content of the articles is extracted by parsing the HTML structure or utilizing HuggingFace models for text extraction, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the articles.

3. Content Summarization and Sentiment Analysis:
   - The HuggingFace small models are applied to perform text summarization, extracting key information from the scraped news articles.
   - Sentiment analysis is conducted using HuggingFace models to determine the sentiment expressed within the articles, allowing users to filter content based on emotional tones.

4. Personalized News Curation:
   - The AI-driven program continually learns from user behavior and preferences to curate a personalized news feed.
   - It adapts to user feedback, rating articles, and analyzing engagement metrics to further refine the article recommendations.
   - The system provides users with the ability to customize their news feed based on specific topics of interest, sources, or sentiment.

5. Continuous Learning and Improvement:
   - The AI model utilized in the project is periodically updated, ensuring the incorporation of the latest advancements in natural language processing and article analysis.
   - User feedback and interaction data are used to fine-tune the recommendations and improve the accuracy of search queries and article extraction.

6. Fully Autonomous Operation:
   - The project is designed to operate autonomously without any manual intervention.
   - It automatically fetches all required resources and dependencies from the web, ensuring smooth operation without relying on local files or hardcoded URLs.
   - The system can be deployed on a cloud platform for continuous operation and scalability.
